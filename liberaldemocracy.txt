Still in its early stages of proper AI development and advances in Machine Learning, deep learning and other computational models able to
create something that closely resembles intuitive AI. This liberal democracy is still very similar to what our country was before the 
trumptocracy took over. These fake democratic countries actually ruled by the interests of big corporations whose capitalisation far 
exceeded the GDP of several non-developed and developing countries, were short of principles and values. Political corruption(an ancient
problem due to the nature of carbon-based limited life) took over every single small nation on the planet. The lack of resources alongside
the automation of jobs due to the early stages of AI revolution urged the people to vote for charismatic fascist leaders with 
protective policies and a strong need to revitalise their countries and build them upon a strong ethical foundations. 
In a moment of scalating tension between distant civilisations in space and time (the fact immortality had not been yet discovered 
made it impossible for inferior religous cultures to embrace science and progress) you are about to break the status-quo and colonise these
inferior temporal and carbon-based beings to continue expanding your evil intergalactic empire.
